# Skin_Lesion_Project
Built an AI-powered skin lesion classification system TL models on the HAM10000 dataset, achieving a 91.11 % test accuracy. Applied SMOTE to improve model generalization; integrated Scikit-learn for hybrid classifiers. Evaluated model performance, demonstrating strong potential for early skin cancer detection in real-world healthcare applications.
